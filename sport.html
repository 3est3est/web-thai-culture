          <h2>Muay Thai (Thai Boxing)</h2>
          <p>
            Muay Thai, or “The Art of Eight Limbs,” is Thailand’s traditional
            martial art with origins dating back to ancient battlefield
            techniques used by Thai warriors. Over the centuries, it developed
            into a cultural sport known for its powerful use of fists, elbows,
            knees, and shins. Rituals like the Wai Kru and Ram Muay highlight
            its deep cultural roots, making Muay Thai a proud symbol of Thai
            identity and heritage.

          <h2>Sepak Takraw</h2>
          <p>
            Sepak Takraw is a traditional Thai sport that combines elements of
            soccer, volleyball, and acrobatics. Players use their feet, knees,
            chest, and head to hit a rattan ball over a high net. Known for its
            impressive flips and kicks, this sport is not only a test of agility
            and teamwork but also a part of Thailand’s rich cultural heritage.
            Sepak Takraw is played in schools, local communities, and
            professional leagues, showcasing the skill and passion of Thai
            athletes.
